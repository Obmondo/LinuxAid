* Thu Oct 31 2019 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 8.5.0-0
- Allow users to knockout entries from arrays specified in Hiera
- Multiple rules added based on best practices mostly pulled from
  /usr/share/doc/auditd:
  - Audit 32 bit operations on 64 bit systems
  - Audit calls to the auditd CLI commands
  - Audit IPv4 and IPv6 inbound connections
  - Optionally audit IPv4 and IPv6 outbound connections
  - Audit suspicious applications
  - Audit systemd
  - Audit the auditd configuration space
  - Ignore time daemon logs (clutter)
  - Ignore CRYPTO_KEY_USER logs (clutter)
  - Add ability to set the backlog_wait_time
  - Set loginuid_immutable

* Thu Oct 24 2019 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 8.5.0-0
- Set defaults for syslog parameters if auditd version is unknown.
- Added support for auditd v3.0 which is used by RedHat 8.
- A fact that determines the major version of auditd that is running on the system
  was added, auditd_major_version.  This is used in hiera.yaml hierarchy to add
  module data specific to the versions.
- Most of the changes in auditd v3.0 were related to how the plugins are handled but there
  are a few new parameters added to auditd.conf.  They were set to their
  defaults according to man of auditd.conf.
- Auditd V3.0 moved the handling of plugins into auditd from audispd.
  The following changes were made to accommodate that:
  - To make sure the parameters used to handle plugins where defined in
    one place no matter what version of auditd was used,
    they were moved to init.pp and referenced from there by the audisp manifest.
    For backwards compatibility, they remain in audisp.conf and are aliased in
    the hiera module data.
  - For backwards compatibility auditd::syslog remains defaulting to the
    value of simp_options::syslog although the two are not really the same thing.
    You might want to review this setting and set auditd::syslog to a setting that
    is appropriate for your system.
    - To enable auditd logging to syslog set the following in hiera:
        auditd::syslog: true
        auditd::config::audisp::syslog::enable: true.
        # The drop_audit_logs is still there for backwards compatibility and
        # needs to be disabled.
        auditd::config::audisp::syslog::drop_audit_logs: false
    - To stop auditd logging to syslog  set the following in hiera:
        auditd::syslog: true
        auditd::config::plugins::syslog::enable: false.
    Setting auditd::syslog to false will stop Puppet from managing the syslog.conf,
    it will not disable auditd logging to syslog.
    been removed.  Disable the syslog plugin as described above.
  - The settings for syslog.conf were updated and to work for new and old
    versions of auditd.
  - Added installation of audisp-syslog package when using auditd v3.

  puppet fixed the service handling.

* Wed Oct 31 2018 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 8.1.0-0
- Allow users to opt-out of hooking the audit dispatchers into the SIMP rsyslog
  module using `auditd::config::audisp::syslog::rsyslog = false` or,
  alternatively, setting `simp_options::syslog = false`.
- Add a `write_logs` opttion to the `auditd_class` and multiplex between the
  `log_format = NOLOG` setting and `write_logs = false` since there were
  breaking changes in these settings after `auditd` version `2.6.0`.
- Add support for `log_format = ENHANCED` for `auditd` version >= `2.6.0`.
  Older versions will simply fall back to `RAW`.

* Tue Oct 16 2018 Nick Markowski <nicholas.markowski@onyxpoint.com> - 8.1.0-0
- Removed unnecessary dependencies from metadata.json.  Now, when users install
  auditd stand-alone i.e. `puppet module install`, they will not have
  extraneous modules clutter their environment.
  - herculesteam/augeasproviders_grub
  - simp/rsyslog

* Fri Oct 12 2018 Nick Miller <nick.miller@onyxpoint.com> - 8.1.0-0

  pages and SCAP expectations.

* Thu Jun 21 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 8.0.0-0
- Added ability to select one or more audit profiles.  When multiple
  profiles are selected, their rules are effectively concatenated in
  the order in which the profiles are listed in
  auditd::default_audit_profiles.
- The following API Changes were made in support of multiple audit
  profiles:
  - $::auditd::$default_audit_profile has been deprecated by
    $::auditd::$default_audit_profiles
  - auditd::config and auditd::config::audit_profiles::simp classes are
    now private.  In the unlikely event that you included just these
    classes in your manifest, you must now include auditd instead.
  - The following auditctl global configuration options that were in
    auditd::config::audit_profiles::simp are now in the auditd class,
    instead: $ignore_errors, $ignore_anonymous, $ignore_system_services,
    and $ignore_crond. They were moved because they are now applied to
    the set of audit profiles selected, not just the 'simp' audit
    profile.
  - The following auditd::config::audit_profiles::simp class parameters
    have been deprecated for clarity:
    - $audit_sudoers has been deprecated by $audit_cfg_sudoers
    - $audit_sudoers_tag has been deprecated by $audit_cfg_sudoers
    - $audit_grub has been deprecated by $audit_cfg_grub
    - $audit_grub_tag has been deprecated by $audit_cfg_grub_tag
    - $audit_yum has been deprecated by $audit_cfg_yum
    - $audit_yum_tag has been deprecated by $audit_cfg_yum_tag
  - Some previously hard-coded, internal configuration is now exposed
    as data-in-modules.
- Added 'stig' audit profile which manages rules that match DISA STIG
  checks, exactly.
  - For executables explicitly listed in the RHEL7 STIG, includes watchs
    for binaries in the real paths (/usr/bin, /usr/sbin) and linked paths
    (/bin, /sbin). This is to address inconsistencies among the STIG and
    the Inspec and OSCAP scans. (All should use the real paths, but don't.)
- Fixed bugs in 'simp' audit profile
  - Fixed umask syscall rules.  These rules require arch filters.
  - Fixed clock_settime syscall rules.  Per the sample STIG audit rules
    packaged in the auditd RPM, these rules require an 'a0' filter.
  - Fixed bug in which /var/log/tallylog was grouped with session
    instead of logins.
  - Fixed bug in which the /etc/pam.d watch rule had the wrong tag
- Updated 'simp' audit profile settings for DISA STIG.
  - Expanded the list of successful syscall operations audited.
  - Expanded the list of module syscall operations audited
  - Added an option to monitor selinux commands, (i.e., chcon,
    semanage, setfiles, setsebool)
  - Added an option to audit the execution of password commands
    ('passwd', 'unix_chkpwd', 'gpasswd', 'chage', 'userhelper')
  - Added an option to audit the execution of privilege-related
    commands ('su', 'sudo', 'newgrp', 'chsh', 'sudoedit')
  - Added an option to audit the execution of postfix-related commands
    ('postdrop', 'postqueue')
  - Added an option to audit the execution of the 'ssh-keysign' command
  - Added an option to audit the execution of the 'crontab' command
  - Added an option to audit the execution of the 'pam_timestamp_check'
    command
  - Added an option to audit the execution of rename/remove operations
    for non-service users (rename', 'renameat', rmdir', 'unlink', and
    'unlinkat')
  - Added watch rules for /etc/hostname and /etc/NetworkManager (for
    centos7) pulled from the sample STIG audit rules packaged in the
    auditd RPM.
  - For executables explicitly listed in the RHEL7 STIG, includes watchs
    for binaries in the real paths (/usr/bin, /usr/sbin) and linked paths
    (/bin, /sbin). This is to address inconsistencies among the STIG and
    the Inspec and OSCAP scans. (All should use the real paths, but don't.)

* Wed Jul 17 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.0.0-10
- Removed the sgid binary check in the audit rules because it doesn't
  actually make any sense.

* Thu Jun 27 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.0.0-9
- Added audit rules to catch the execution of sgid and suid binaries.
- Added the ability to rate limit the auditd messages. If you use this, you
  probably want to change the failure mode to 1.
- Added the ability to ignore failures in the audit configuration and continue

  likelihood of one being wrong is fairly high. Also, rules will fail if a file
  doesn't exist which isn't all that helpful.
- Removed the watch on /proc/kcore since it wasn't really helpful and was
  throwing SELinux AVC's on startup.

* Fri Feb 19 2010 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 0.1-11
- Removed watch on /etc. That was a very bad rule.

* Tue Dec 15 2009 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 0.1-10

  Previously, the 64 bit calls were not handled properly.
