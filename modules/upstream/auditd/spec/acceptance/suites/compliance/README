Due to a bug in rpm, RPMs fail to upgrade when a symlink to a
directory changes to an actual directory or vice versa.
(See https://pagure.io/packaging-committee/issue/385 ).

In pupmod-simp-auditd version 7.1.2, 'nodesets' was a link.
However, beginning with 7.1.3, this suite no longer uses the
same nodeset as the default suite.  So, to avoid the
link-to-directory RPM upgrade problem, we have replaced the
'nodesets' link with a link to another directory,
'local.nodesets'.
