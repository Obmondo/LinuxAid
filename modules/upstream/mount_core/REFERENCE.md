## Resource types

### mount

Manages mounted filesystems, including putting mount
information into the mount table. The actual behavior depends
on the value of the 'ensure' parameter.

**Refresh:** `mount` resources can respond to refresh events (via
`notify`, `subscribe`, or the `~>` arrow). If a `mount` receives an event
from another resource **and** its `ensure` attribute is set to `mounted`,
Puppet will try to unmount then remount that filesystem.

**Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing any parents of a mount resource ---
that is, other mount points higher up in the filesystem --- the child
mount will autorequire them.

**Autobefores:**  If Puppet is managing any child file paths of a mount
point, the mount resource will autobefore them.

#### Properties

The following properties are available in the `mount` type.

##### `ensure`

Valid values: defined, present, unmounted, absent, mounted

Aliases: "present"=>"defined"

Control what to do with this mount. Set this attribute to
`unmounted` to make sure the filesystem is in the filesystem table
but not mounted (if the filesystem is currently mounted, it will be
unmounted).  Set it to `absent` to unmount (if necessary) and remove
the filesystem from the fstab.  Set to `mounted` to add it to the
fstab and mount it. Set to `present` to add to fstab but not change
mount/unmount status.

##### `device`

The device providing the mount.  This can be whatever
device is supporting by the mount, including network
devices or devices specified by UUID rather than device
path, depending on the operating system.

##### `blockdevice`

The device to fsck.  This is property is only valid
on Solaris, and in most cases will default to the correct
value.

##### `fstype`

The mount type.  Valid values depend on the
operating system.  This is a required option.

##### `options`

A single string containing options for the mount, as they would
appear in fstab on Linux. For many platforms this is a comma-delimited
string. Consult the fstab(5) man page for system-specific details.
AIX options other than dev, nodename, or vfs can be defined here. If
specified, AIX options of account, boot, check, free, mount, size,
type, vol, log, and quota must be ordered alphabetically at the end of
the list.

##### `pass`

The pass in which the mount is checked.

##### `atboot`

Whether to mount the mount at boot.  Not all platforms
support this.

##### `dump`

Whether to dump the mount.  Not all platform support this.
Valid values are `1` or `0` (or `2` on FreeBSD). Default is `0`.

##### `target`

The file in which to store the mount table.  Only used by
those providers that write to disk.

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `mount` type.

##### `name`

namevar

The mount path for the mount.

##### `remounts`

Valid values: `true`, `false`

Whether the mount can be remounted  `mount -o remount`.  If
this is false, then the filesystem will be unmounted and remounted
manually, which is prone to failure.
