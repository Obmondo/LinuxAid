## Overview

A puppet module for installing and configuring [elastic-curator](https://github.com/elastic/curator).
This module was forked from [ccin2p3-puppet-curator](https://github.com/ccin2p3/puppet-curator) which is a fork of 
cristifalcas-curator and was updated for curator4.

## Module Description

Curator is used to manage and clean up time-series elasticsearch indexes, this module manages curator.

NOTE: If you are using curator < 4.0.0 use a previous version of this module.

The original module allowed you to create various cron jobs for curator.

The new module will only create the config file, one action file and ensure the last folder of the path. 
If there is more than one (folder-)level missing you will have to create that folders externally before this module runs. 
e.g. "/etc/curator/my_settings/" you have to ensure that "/etc/curator" is present.

Also, now it is your job to create the cron job:

```puppet
  cron { "curator_run":
    ensure  => 'present',
    command => '/bin/curator /root/.curator/actions.yml >/dev/null',
    hour    => 1,
    minute  => 10,
    weekday => '*',
  }
```

## Setup

### What curator affects

* curator package
* curator config

### Beginning with curator

Installation of the curator module:

```
  puppet module install pest-curator
```

## Usage

Generic curator install via pip (requires pip is installed)
```puppet
  class { 'curator': }
```

Install via yum
```puppet
  class { 'curator':
    package_name => 'python-elasticsearch-curator',
    provider     => 'yum'
  }
```

Close indexes over 2 days old
```puppet
  curator::action { 'apache_close':
    action                => 'close',
    continue_if_exception => 'True',
    filters               => [
      {
        'filtertype' => 'age',
        'direction'  => 'older',
        'timestring' => '"%Y.%m.%d"',
        'unit'       => 'days',
        'unit_count' => '2',
        'source'     => 'name',
      }
    ]
  }
```

Delete logstash indexes older than a week
```puppet
  curator::action { 'delete_indices':
    action                => 'delete_indices',
    continue_if_exception => 'True',
    filters               => [
      {
        'filtertype' => 'pattern',
        'value'      => 'logstash-',
        'kind'       => 'prefix',
      },
      {
        'filtertype' => 'age',
        'direction'  => 'older',
        'timestring' => '"%Y.%m.%d"',
        'unit'       => 'days',
        'unit_count' => '7',
        'source'     => 'name',
      }
    ]
  }
```

Currently this package supports installing curator via pip or your local
package manager.  RPM packages can easly be created by running:

```
fpm -s python -t rpm urllib3
fpm -s python -t rpm elasticsearch
fpm -s python -t rpm click
fpm -s python -t rpm elasticsearch-curator
```
