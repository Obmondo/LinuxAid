    # Restricts the test on the master's puppetserver collection. There are two
    # types of restrictions that can be applied
    #
    # * Restrict the test to only run on a specific puppetserver collection. Here's
    # an example of how you can specify this restriction:
    #
    # test_name 'an agent upgrade test' do
    #   require_master_collection 'puppet5'
    # end
    #
    # This will run the test if the master's puppetserver is from the puppet5 collection;
    # otherwise, the test will be skipped.
    #
    # * Restrict the test to run on a valid range of collections. There are several ways
    # you can specify this restriction:
    #
    # test_name 'an agent upgrade test' do
    #   require_master_collection min: 'PC1', max: 'puppet5'
    # end
    #
    # test_name 'an agent upgrade test' do

    #
    # test_name 'an agent upgrade test' do
    #   require_master_collection max: 'puppet7'
    # end
    #
    # The first restriction will only run the test if the master's puppetserver is from
    # the puppet4 collection or newer, but no newer than puppet5. The second restriction
    # will only run the test if the master's puppetserver is from the puppet4 collection
    # or newer. The third restriction will only run the test if the master's puppetserver
    # is from the puppet6 collection or older.
    #
    # NOTE: Be sure to put this DSL first in your test, before any confines. Otherwise,
    # you could accidentally filter out your master and thus raise an exception here.
