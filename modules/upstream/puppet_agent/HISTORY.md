## [1.2.0] - 2016-05-04

### Summary
Supports upgrades from puppet-agent packages! Applies to both PE and FOSS, for example upgrades from
PE 2015.3.2 to 2015.3.3 and puppet-agent 1.3.0 to 1.4.0 are supported. Upgrading from older Puppet 3
versions is also no longer explicitly prevented. Adds support for Solaris 11.

### Known issues
Carried-over from prior releases:
- For Windows, trigger an agent run after upgrade to get Puppet to create the necessary directory structures.
- Upgrades on EL4-based systems are not supported.
- Upgrades on Fedora systems are not supported.

Newly identified issues:
- Mac OS X Open Source package upgrades are not yet implemented.
- AIX package names are based on PowerPC architecture version. PowerPC 8 is not yet supported.

### Features
- Upgrades between puppet-agent packages, such as 2015.2.x to 2015.3.x.
- Adds support for Solaris 11.
- The `pluginsync` setting was deprecated in `puppet-agent 1.4.0`. This module removes it when upgrading to
that version or later unless otherwise managed.
- Remove the lower-version requirement. All Puppet 3 versions potentially can be upgraded, although
testing is only performed starting with Puppet/PE 3.8. Earlier versions likely work back to 3.5, as long as
the manifest is compiled using 3.7+ with future parser enabled.

### Bug fixes
- Fixes the release identification for Amazon Linux distributions to use EL 6 packages.
- Fix Debian upgrades for PE.
- Support upgrades of 32-bit Windows packages for PE (via pe_repo).
