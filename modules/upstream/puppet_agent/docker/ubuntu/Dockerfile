# This Dockerfile enables an iterative development workflow where you can make
# a change and test it out quickly. The majority of commands in this file will
# be cached, making the feedback loop typically quite short. The workflow is
# as follows:
#   1. Set up pre-conditions for the system in puppet code using `deploy.pp`.
#   2. Make a change to the module.
#   3. Run `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile .` or
#      `./docker/bin/upgrade.sh ubuntu` from the project directory. If you would
#      like to test specific version upgrades, you can add run this like so:
#        `docker build -f docker/ubuntu/Dockerfile . \
#           -t pa-dev:ubuntu --build-arg before=1.10.14`
#   4. Upgrade the container by running the image:
#        `docker run -it pa-dev:ubuntu`
#      Specify your upgrade TO version as an argument to the `docker run`
#      command.
#   5. Review the output. Repeat steps 2-5 as needed.
#
# At the end of execution, you will see a line like:
#
# Notice: /Stage[main]/Puppet_agent::Install/Package[puppet-agent]/ensure: ensure changed '1.10.14-1xenial' to '6.2.0-1xenial'
#
# This specifies the versions that were used for upgrade.
#

# - before: The version to do upgrade FROM. Default: "1.10.14"
