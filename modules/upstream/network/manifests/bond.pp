# = Define: network::bond
#
# Instantiate cross-platform bonded interfaces
#
# == Parameters
#
# === interface parameters
#
# [*ensure*]
#
# The ensure value for the bonding interface.
#
# Default: present
#
# [*ipaddress*]
#
# The IPv4 address of the interface.
#
# [*netmask*]
#
# The IPv4 network mask of the interface.
#
# [*method*]
#
# The network configuration method.
#
# [*onboot*]
#
# Whether to bring the interface up on boot.
#
# [*hotplug*]
#
# Whether to allow hotplug for the interface.
#
# [*mtu*]
#
# The Maximum Transmission Unit size to use for bond interface and all slaves.
#
# [*options*]
#
# Hash with custom interfaces options.
#
# [*slave_options*]
#
# Hash with custom slave interfaces options.
#
# === bonding parameters
#
# [*slaves*]
#
# A list of slave interfaces to combine for the bonded interface.
#
# [*mode*]
#
# The interface bond mode. The value can be either the human readable term,
# such as 'active-backup' or the numeric representation, such as '1'.
#
# Default: 'active-backup'
#
# Options:
#   - balance-rr/0
#   - active-backup/1
#   - blancer-xor/2
#   - broadcast/3
#   - 802.3ad/4
#   - balance-tlb/5
#   - balance-alb/6
#
# [*miimon*]
#
# The MII link monitoring frequency in milliseconds.
#
# Default: 100
#
# [*downdelay*]
#
# The time in milliseconds, to wait before disabling a slave after a link
# failure has been detected.
#
# Default: 200
#
# [*updelay*]
#
# The time in millisceonds to wait before enabling a slave after a link
# recovery has been detected.
#
# [*lacp_rate*]
#
#
# Option specifying the rate in which we'll ask our link partner to transmit
# LACPDU packets in 802.3ad mode. Only applicable when mode is '802.3ad'.
#
# Options:
#   - slow/0: Request partner to transmit LACPDUs every 30 seconds
#   - fast/1: Request partner to transmit LACPDUs every 1 second
#
#
# [*primary*]
#
# The primary interface to use when the mode is 'active-backup'. All other
# interfaces will be offline by default. Only applicable when mode is '802.3ad'.
#
# Default: $slaves[0]
#
# [*primary_reselect*]
#
# Specifies the reselection policy for the primary slave. This affects how
# the primary slave is chosen to become the active slave when failure of the
# active slave or recovery of the primary slave occurs. This option is
# designed to prevent flip-flopping between the primary slave and other slaves.
#
# Options:
#   - always/0
#   - better/1
#   - failure/2
#
# [*xmit_hash_policy*]
#
# Selects the transmit hash policy to use for slave selection in balance-xor
# and 802.3ad modes.
#
# Options:
#   - layer2
#   - layer2+3
#   - layer3+4
#
# == Examples

#       ipaddress => '172.16.1.2',
