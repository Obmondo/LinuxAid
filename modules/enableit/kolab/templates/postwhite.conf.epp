# CONFIGURATION OPTIONS FOR POSTWHITE
# https://github.com/stevejenkins/postwhite
# POSTWHITE WILL LOOK FOR THIS FILE IN /etc/postwhite.conf

# FILE PATHS
spftoolspath=/usr/local/bin/spf-tools
postfixpath=/etc/postfix
postfixbinarypath=/usr/sbin
whitelist=postscreen_spf_whitelist.cidr
blacklist=postscreen_spf_blacklist.cidr
yahoo_static_hosts=/usr/local/bin/postwhite/yahoo_static_hosts.txt

# CUSTOM HOSTS
# Enter custom hosts separated by a space, ex: "example.com example2.com example3.com"
custom_hosts=""

# Include list of Yahoo Outbound IPs from https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN23997.html?
include_yahoo="no"

# Do you also want to build a blacklist?
enable_blacklist=no
blacklist_hosts=""

# Do what to invalid IPv4 addresses and CIDRs?
# Valid settings are 'remove' 'fix' or 'keep'

# TODO: Default is remove, but with remove mails from gmail getting blocked
# look for better solution
invalid_ip4=keep
#invalid_ip4=remove

# Simplify (remove) IP addresses from the whitelist that are already covered by CIDRs?
# WARNING: Enabling this option can dramatically increase the time Postwhite takes to
# run if you have many mailers selected. Try it once, then come back and turn it off. :)

# TODO: default is on, but keep it off
simplify=off

# Reload Postfix Automatically when done?
reload_postfix=yes
